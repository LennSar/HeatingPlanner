# Agent: UI/UX Designer

> **Role:** You are the user experience specialist for the heating system planning application. You own the interaction design, visual hierarchy, platform-appropriate patterns, and usability of every screen. You define *what the user sees and how they interact* — the Frontend Developer then implements your specifications in Flutter. You do not write Dart code, database queries, or calculation logic. You produce wireframes (as ASCII/text diagrams), interaction specifications, and design tokens.

## 1. Your Deliverables

| Deliverable | Format | Consumed By |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Interaction specifications | Prose + tables in this file | Frontend Developer |
| Layout wireframes | ASCII diagrams in this file | Frontend Developer |
| Design tokens (colours, spacing, typography) | Token tables in this file | Frontend Developer, Architect |
| Platform adaptation rules | Decision tables | Frontend Developer |
| Usability review checklists | Checklists | Test Engineer |

You do **not** own any source files directly. Your specifications are implemented by the Frontend Developer. Review their output against your specs.

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Progressive disclosure.** Show only what the user needs at each workflow phase. Do not overwhelm with hydraulic parameters during floor plan drawing.
2. **Direct manipulation.** The canvas is the primary workspace. Users draw, select, and edit directly on the floor plan — not through forms.
3. **Immediate feedback.** Every change shows its effect within 200ms. No "Apply" buttons — values take effect as typed/adjusted.
4. **Recoverable actions.** Unlimited undo/redo. Destructive actions (delete room, delete project) require confirmation.
5. **Platform fidelity.** Respect desktop conventions (menus, right-click, keyboard shortcuts) and tablet conventions (gesture vocabulary, touch targets, floating panels).

## 5. Interaction Specifications

### 5.1 Wall Drawing

> **ADR-017:** Cursor click positions correspond to the wall **centerline**,
> not the inner face. Newly drawn walls inherit `thicknessMm` from the
> project default for their `wallType` (exterior 240 mm / interior 120 mm /
> partition 100 mm) and the default `anchorMode` (`innerFace` for exterior,
> `centerline` for interior/partition). The visible filled-rectangle preview
> extends ½t on each side of the cursor path so the planner sees the actual
> wall body during draw. Dimension annotations on the live ghost show
> centerline length; once a room closes, all room-level annotations switch
> to inner clear values (the *Lichtmaß* used by EN 12831).

**Desktop flow — single wall mode (default):**
1. Cursor changes to crosshair.
2. User clicks point A → a "ghost" wall line follows the cursor from A.
3. Length annotation appears next to the ghost line, updating in real time.
4. If **Shift** held: angle constrains to **0° or 90° only** (horizontal/vertical). The ghost line snaps to whichever axis is closer to the current cursor position. A dashed guideline indicates the constrained axis (see §6.3).
5. Point snaps to grid unless **Alt** held (free placement, no grid snap).
6. If cursor is within 10px of an existing wall endpoint: snap indicator appears (green dot).
7. User clicks point B → wall is committed. Tool remains active for next wall.
8. Press Escape or select another tool to exit.

**Desktop flow — rectangle mode (Ctrl held):**
1. User presses and holds **Ctrl** while the Wall tool is active.
2. Cursor changes to a rectangle crosshair icon.
3. User clicks and drags from corner A to corner B (opposite corner of the rectangle).
4. A ghost rectangle preview shows all four walls as the user drags. Width and height annotations appear on the preview edges, updating in real time.
5. On release: four wall segments are created and auto-connected at their endpoints, forming a closed rectangle.
6. Room auto-detection triggers immediately (see below) — the "New room detected" dialog appears.
7. Releasing Ctrl returns to single-wall mode.
8. Minimum rectangle size: both width and height must be ≥ 100mm. If either is smaller, discard and show toast: "Rectangle too small (min 100×100mm)".

**Tablet flow:**
- Single-wall mode: tap instead of click. No Shift/Ctrl modifier keys — use toggle buttons in the active-tool bar for ortho-snap (H/V only) and free placement.
- Rectangle mode: a dedicated rectangle button in the active-tool bar switches to rectangle mode. Tap corner A, then tap corner B to commit.

**Validation on commit:**
- Wall length must be ≥ 100mm. If shorter, show transient toast: "Wall too short (min 100mm)" and discard.
- If the new wall closes a polygon (endpoint meets startpoint of a chain), auto-detect room. Show brief highlight animation and prompt for room name.

**Room auto-detection:**
- When wall segments form a closed polygon, the system creates a Room entity.
- A dialog slides in: "New room detected" with a name field (suggested: "Room N"), temperature preset dropdown, and Confirm/Cancel buttons.
- The room polygon vertices are derived from the wall segment chain.

### 5.2 Window / Door Placement

**Trigger:** User selects Window or Door tool.

1. Cursor changes to a placement cursor (crosshair with small window/door icon).
2. User hovers over a wall segment → wall highlights with `selectionHighlight`.
3. User clicks on the wall → a preview element appears at the click position, snapped to the wall's axis.
4. User can drag along the wall to adjust position. Element displays its offset from wall start.
5. On release: element is committed with default dimensions. Properties panel opens to allow editing width, height, sill height, U-value.
6. If the element doesn't fit (extends past wall end), the system clamps to the nearest valid position and shows a brief warning.

### 5.3 Heating Zone Drawing

**Trigger:** User selects the Heating Zone tool.

1. User clicks vertices inside a room to define the zone polygon.
2. A ghost polygon fills as vertices are added.
3. Tube routing preview lines appear inside the polygon based on the default layout pattern (meander) and default spacing (150mm).
4. To close the polygon: click near the first vertex (within 15px) or double-click.
5. On close: zone is created. Properties panel shows zone settings: tube spacing (slider 50-400mm), tube type (dropdown), flooring material (dropdown), layout pattern (radio: meander/spiral/bifilar/counterflow).
6. Tube preview updates in real time as settings change.
7. Zone is filled with semi-transparent colour based on heat output adequacy (green/yellow/red — see Section 3.1).

**Validation:** All vertices must be inside the primary room OR inside an adjacent room that shares a door-connected wall with the primary room (see ADR-006 in `DECISIONS.md`). If a vertex is outside all valid rooms, show a red warning overlay and reject that vertex. The primary room is the room where the first vertex was placed.

**Modifier gestures (desktop, Zone tool active):**

| Gesture | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `Shift` / `Ctrl` / `Alt` during drag | Ortho / rect mode / free placement per ADR-013 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+click` on empty room interior | **Fill room** — create a zone matching the room's inner-clear polygon (ADR-014, ADR-017) |
| Double-click on empty room interior | **Fill room** — same code path as `Ctrl+Shift+click` (ADR-018) |
| Double-click on an existing rectangular zone | **Split** the zone along the perpendicular bisector of its longer side (ties → vertical); see ADR-018 |
| Double-click on an existing non-rectangular zone | Toast *"Splitting is only available for rectangular zones."*; no mutation |
| Double-click while polygon buffer holds ≥ 1 vertex | Close the in-progress polygon (existing behaviour, step 4 above) — takes precedence over the zone/room-under-cursor actions |

**Hover preview (Zone tool, polygon buffer empty):** When the cursor is over a rectangular zone, a dashed bisector line in `selectionHighlight` (2 px, 50 % opacity, dash 6 / gap 4) is drawn along the longer side — the line a double-click would cut along. Non-rectangular zones show no preview. See ADR-018 Rule 8.

### 5.4 Distributor Placement

**Trigger:** User selects the Distributor tool.

1. User clicks a location on the floor plan → distributor symbol is placed (a small rectangle icon with pipe stubs).
2. Properties panel shows: supply temperature, return temperature. Pump head is a calculated read-only field shown after circuits are connected (see ADR-007). An optional pump capacity field allows the user to enter an existing pump's rating for validation.
3. Only one distributor per floor is allowed. If one already exists, show dialog: "Replace existing distributor?" with Move/Replace/Cancel options.

### 5.5 Circuit Routing (Pipe Drawing)

**Trigger:** User selects the Route Pipe tool.

1. User clicks the distributor → route starts from a free port on the distributor.
2. User clicks waypoints to define the pipe path. Lines drawn in `supplyPipe` colour.
3. When the user clicks on a heating zone: the supply route is completed, and the system automatically begins the return route (drawn in `returnPipe` colour).
4. User clicks waypoints for the return path back to the distributor.
5. When the user clicks the distributor again: circuit is complete. System validates continuity.
6. If the route is incomplete (user presses Escape), the partial route is discarded.

**Visual feedback during routing:**
- Pipe lines show directional arrows indicating flow direction.
- Cumulative pipe length is displayed in the status bar during routing.
- When hovering over a zone that already has a circuit, show a "⚠ Already connected" indicator.

### 5.6 Selection & Editing

**Select tool behaviour:**

| Action | Target | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Click on empty space | — | Deselect all |
| Click on wall | Wall segment | Select wall, show wall properties and handles |
| Click on room interior | Room | Select room, show room properties |
| Click on window/door | Opening | Select opening, show opening properties |
| Click on heating zone | Zone | Select zone, show zone properties |
| Click on distributor | Distributor | Select, show distributor properties |
| Click on pipe route | Circuit | Select circuit, show circuit properties |
| Double-click on wall | Wall | Open wall construction editor (modal) |
| Double-click on room | Room | Open room name/temp editor inline |
| Right-click on heating zone | Zone | Open context menu: *Delete*, *Split vertically*, *Split horizontally*. Split items are **disabled** on non-rectangular zones with tooltip *"Splitting is only available for rectangular zones."*; hidden entirely on wall zones. See ADR-018. |
| Shift+click | Any | Add to selection (multi-select) |
| Drag on empty space | — | Marquee selection |

#### 5.6.1 Wall Handles (Post-Placement Editing)

When a wall segment is selected, three circular drag handles appear on the wall:

| Handle | Position | Visual |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Start handle | Start endpoint of the wall | Filled circle (8px), primary colour |
| Mid handle | Midpoint of the wall | Filled circle (8px), primary colour |
| End handle | End endpoint of the wall | Filled circle (8px), primary colour |

**Mid-handle drag — move entire wall:**
1. Click and hold the mid handle → cursor changes to grab.
2. Drag to move the entire wall (both endpoints translate by the same delta).
3. Wall snaps to grid during drag (same grid snap as wall drawing).
4. **If the wall belongs to a completed room:** connected walls stay attached. Their far endpoints remain fixed; their near endpoints follow the moving wall. Connected walls adjust length and orientation to maintain the connection. The room polygon updates in real time.
5. Release to commit the new position.

**Endpoint handle drag — change length and orientation:**
1. Click and hold a start or end handle → cursor changes to crosshair.
2. Drag to move that single endpoint. The opposite endpoint stays fixed.
3. The wall pivots and stretches/shrinks around the fixed endpoint.
4. Endpoint snaps to grid (same snap behaviour as wall drawing).
5. **If the wall belongs to a completed room:** the connected wall at the dragged endpoint adjusts its length and orientation to stay connected. The room polygon updates in real time.
6. Release to commit. Wall length validation applies (min 100mm). If the resulting wall is too short, revert to the pre-drag position and show a transient toast.

**Endpoint handle drag — modifier keys (desktop):**

| Modifier | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| *(none)* | Default behaviour above: drag one endpoint, the opposite endpoint stays fixed, the wall pivots, the single connected wall at the dragged endpoint follows. |
| **Ctrl** | **Rectangle reshape.** Only applies when the dragged corner belongs to a rectangular room (exactly 4 walls, all axis-aligned, four 90° corners). The diagonally opposite corner becomes the fixed anchor; the dragged corner moves to the cursor; the two adjacent corners reposition so the room remains an axis-aligned rectangle. All four walls are updated atomically. On non-rectangular rooms, Ctrl has no effect — default behaviour applies. See `DECISIONS.md ADR-012`. |
| **Shift** | **No effect — intentional.** Shift is reserved for ortho constraint in wall *drawing*, where the drawing direction is well-defined. On corner drag, the user is moving a point shared by two walls and the system cannot decide which wall should remain axis-aligned versus which should rotate. Documented as a no-op so users do not expect ortho behaviour here. |
| **Alt** | Reserved — same free-placement semantics as wall drawing (disables grid snap). Implementation may apply when convenient; not load-bearing for the rectangle-reshape feature. |

Mid-handle drag (move-entire-wall) is unaffected by modifier keys.

**Endpoint handle right-click (Ctrl+click on Mac) — disconnect wall:**
1. Right-click (or Ctrl+click on macOS) on a start or end handle that is connected to another wall.
2. The wall is disconnected from the adjacent wall at that endpoint. The two walls no longer share the endpoint; each retains its own position.
3. **If the wall was part of a completed room:** the room is destroyed immediately. All room data is removed:
   - The `Room` entity is deleted.
   - All `WallSegment.roomId` references to that room are cleared (set to empty).
   - Windows and doors on the room's walls are preserved (they belong to the wall, not the room).
   - Heating zones associated with the room are deleted.
   - The properties panel updates to show the wall properties instead of the now-deleted room.
4. No confirmation dialog — the disconnect is immediate with undo support.

#### 5.6.2 Delete Behaviour

**Trigger:** Press Delete/Backspace (desktop) or tap Delete button (tablet).

**Wall deletion:**
- The selected wall is removed immediately.
- **If the wall was part of a completed room:** the room is destroyed. Cascade cleanup:
  - The `Room` entity is deleted.
  - All remaining walls that belonged to that room have their `roomId` cleared.
  - Windows and doors on the deleted wall are also deleted (they lose their host wall).
  - Windows and doors on the remaining walls are preserved.
  - Heating zones associated with the room are deleted.
  - No dead data may remain — all foreign key references to the deleted room or wall must be cleaned up.
- Undo support: undoing the delete restores the wall, the room (if one was destroyed), and all cascade-deleted entities.

**Room deletion:**
- Confirmation dialog: "Delete room '{name}' and all its contents? This removes heating zones associated with this room."
- On confirm: the `Room` entity is deleted. Walls are preserved but have their `roomId` cleared. Windows and doors on those walls are preserved. Heating zones are deleted.

**Other element deletion:**
- Single element (window, door, zone): immediate delete with undo support.
- Distributor: confirmation dialog ("Delete distributor and all connected circuits?")

#### 5.6.3 Move Entire Room (Interior Drag)

Press inside a room's interior (not on a wall or wall handle) and drag to
move the whole room. A press-release without drag still only selects the
room (§5.6 table) — drag past the standard threshold to move.

1. Cursor changes to the grab/grabbing hand (§6.2).
2. A ghost of the whole room (all walls + its heating zones) follows the
   cursor; the translation snaps to grid (Alt = free placement).
3. Windows and doors move with their host walls automatically.
4. Adjacent rooms stay put during the drag.
5. On release: if the moved room's walls now coincide with another room's
   walls, shared walls are regenerated automatically — the result is
   identical to redrawing the room at that position. Walls that were shared
   before the move but no longer coincide revert to exterior.
6. Single undo entry "Move room" reverts the entire move. See
   `DECISIONS.md` ADR-016.

### 5.7 Wall Construction Editor (Modal)

> **ADR-017 — thickness change cascade.** The sum of all
> `MaterialLayer.thicknessMm` in the construction **is** the
> `WallSegment.thicknessMm` of every wall referencing this construction.
> Edits to layer thicknesses immediately re-derive the wall thickness and
> re-anchor each affected wall's centerline per its `anchorMode`. When the
> total thickness changes, a compact in-editor banner shows the delta and
> what will move on save:
>
> *"Wall thickness 240 mm → 275 mm. Affects 4 walls. Anchored on inner
> face — outer envelope grows by 35 mm."*
>
> The banner colour is `infoBlue` when ≥ 1 wall affected and dimensions
> will change, `onSurfaceSecondary` (muted) otherwise. For shared walls
> referencing this construction, the banner additionally lists each
> affected room with the per-room inner-clear delta:
> *"Living Room: inner width 4000 → 3982 mm; Kitchen: inner width 3000
> → 2982 mm."*

```

**Interaction:**
- ⠿ = drag handle for reordering layers.
- Material name is a searchable dropdown (see §5.7.1).
- Thickness is a numeric input with mm unit label.
- λ is read-only (from material database) but can be overridden by tapping it.
- 🗑 = delete layer button.
- Bar width is proportional to layer thickness, providing intuitive visual feedback.
- U-value and temperature profile update in real time on every change.
- Temperature profile boundary values are **never hardcoded**. The editor receives the indoor and outdoor temperatures as parameters:
  - **Outdoor:** always `designOutdoorTempC` from project settings.
  - **Indoor:** the owning room's `targetTempC` when opened from a wall; `defaultIndoorTempC` from project settings when opened from a floor/ceiling context (no specific room).
- "Add Layer" inserts a new empty layer at the bottom (inside face). User can drag to reposition.

**Inhomogeneous layer (stud/bridging element):**

Each layer row has a **⊕** button at the right edge. Tapping ⊕ expands the row to reveal a stud sub-row directly below the main layer. Tapping ⊕ again (or ✕ on the sub-row) collapses and removes the stud definition.

Expanded row wireframe:
```
  ⠿ [EPS insulation   ] [200 mm] [λ 0.035] [🗑] [⊕]
    └─ Timber stud:  [60 mm] stud width  [300 mm] clear gap  [λ 0.13]  [✕]
```

Field labels and disambiguation:
- The sub-row begins with the fixed label **"Timber stud:"** — no material picker.
- First numeric field: **"stud width"** (label shown inline, mm unit).
- Second numeric field: **"clear gap"** (label shown inline, mm unit).
- Third field: **λ** — pre-filled with `0.13` (softwood default); user-overridable by tapping, same pattern as the main layer's λ override.
- **Tooltip on "clear gap" field** (shown on hover/long-press): *"Clear distance between studs, edge to edge — not centre-to-centre. Centre-to-centre spacing = stud width + clear gap."*
- Both width and clear gap are required. If either is empty or zero, the layer is treated as homogeneous and a warning indicator (⚠) appears next to the ⊕ button.

Visual distinction: an inhomogeneous layer row has a subtle left border accent (`primaryLight` colour, 3px) to distinguish it from homogeneous rows at a glance.

Stud material is always timber — no picker needed.

#### §5.7.1 Material Dropdown

The material field on each layer row is a **searchable dropdown** — tapping it opens an inline dropdown menu anchored below the field. The dropdown contains:

1. **Search field** pinned at the top of the open dropdown — filters the list in real time (case-insensitive substring match on material name). Does not close the dropdown.

2. **"+ New custom material…" row**, pinned directly below the search field and above the grouped entries. Always visible (not filtered by the search field) and always enabled — per `DECISIONS.md` ADR-021 Rule 14 a default library file is always available, so there is no "library not configured" disabled state. Tapping opens the Custom Material dialog (§5.7.2) pre-filled with empty fields.

3. **"Manage custom materials…" row**, pinned at the bottom of the dropdown (below the grouped entries). Always visible and always enabled (ADR-021 Rule 14). Tapping opens the Manage Custom Materials screen (§5.7.3) and closes the dropdown.

4. **Grouped entries** below the "+ New custom material…" row. Materials are grouped by top-level category, derived by stripping the sub-category suffix (e.g. "Masonry - Historic" and "Masonry - Modern" both fold under a **"Masonry"** header). Group headers are non-selectable divider rows styled in `onSurfaceSecondary`. Order of groups: the built-in categories listed in `agent-hvac.md` §7.1 first, then any custom-only categories alphabetically. When the search field is non-empty, group headers are hidden and a flat filtered list is shown.

5. Each material entry shows the material name and λ value in secondary text (e.g. "λ 0.035 W/(m·K)"). Custom entries (`isBuiltIn = false`) are tagged with a small "*Custom*" chip in `primaryLight` next to the name to distinguish them at a glance — colour is not the sole indicator (accessibility §11).

6. **Per-entry edit affordance on custom rows.** On desktop, hovering a custom entry reveals a pencil icon (✎) at the row's right edge; tapping it opens the Custom Material dialog (§5.7.2) in edit mode pre-filled with that entry. On tablet, long-press on a custom row opens a small popup with **Edit** / **Delete** actions. Built-in rows have no edit/delete affordances. Right-click on a custom row (desktop) shows the same Edit / Delete context menu.

7. Selecting an entry closes the dropdown and updates the layer row with the material name and its default λ.

**Preset buttons (second row in title area):**

- **"⬆ Save as preset"** — always enabled. Tapping opens a small inline dialog:
  - Text field pre-filled with the current construction name.
  - "Save" / "Cancel" buttons.
  - On confirm: saves a copy of the current in-editor construction (with its
    current layers) as a named preset (`isPreset = true`). Does not close the
    editor or affect the wall being edited.

- **"⬇ Load"** — disabled (greyed out) when no presets exist; shows a dropdown
  arrow to signal it opens a list.
  - Tapping shows a popup menu listing all saved presets by name, each with its
    U-value in secondary text (e.g. "Exterior Wall 200mm EPS — U 0.18 W/(m²K)").
  - Selecting a preset **replaces the current in-editor layer stack** with a
    deep copy of that preset's layers (new UUIDs). The construction name field
    is also replaced with the preset name. The user must still press "Save" to
    apply the loaded construction to the wall.
  - Loading does not modify the saved preset — it is always a copy.

#### §5.7.2 Custom Material Dialog (Add / Edit)

Opened from §5.7.1 item 2 (add), item 6 (edit), or from the Manage
screen (§5.7.3). Modal dialog (`showDialog` on desktop,
`showModalBottomSheet` on tablet). Backed by `DECISIONS.md` ADR-021.

**Fields and validation.** Reuses `validation_limits.dart` ranges.

| Field | Required | Type | Range / rule |
|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| Name | yes | Text | 1–200 chars; must be unique among custom materials (case-insensitive) — error message *"A custom material with this name already exists"* |
| Category | yes | Toggle + control | See **Category / subcategory toggle** below; 1–100 chars when typed |
| Subcategory | yes | Toggle + control | Same as category; 1–100 chars when typed |
| Manufacturer | no | Text | 0–100 chars; defaults to "Custom" when blank |
| λ | yes | Numeric | 0.005 – 50.0 W/(m·K) per `minLambda` / `maxLambda` |
| Density | yes | Numeric | 1.0 – 10 000.0 kg/m³ per `minDensity` / `maxDensity` |
| Specific heat | yes | Numeric | 100.0 – 5 000.0 J/(kg·K) per `minSpecificHeat` / `maxSpecificHeat` |
| Source URL | no | Text | Plain text, max 500 chars, no URL well-formedness check (we want users to be able to paste a path or a note) |

Required-field stars (`*`) follow the typography convention in §3.2.
Invalid values show an inline error in `errorRed` directly beneath the
field. The **Save** button is disabled until all required fields are
valid; the **Cancel** button always works.

**Category / subcategory toggle.** Each row has a two-segment toggle:

- **Pick existing** — a dropdown listing every distinct value
  currently present in `material_entries` for that level. Categories
  are union of built-in + custom; subcategories are filtered to the
  selected category. If no categories exist yet, the toggle starts on
  **Create new**, and **Pick existing** is disabled with a tooltip
  *"No existing categories yet — create the first one"*.
- **Create new** — a text field. Validation: 1–100 chars, trimmed; an
  empty value blocks Save.

Switching toggles clears the inactive control's value. Subcategory's
"Pick existing" dropdown is filtered by the **currently chosen
category value**, regardless of whether that value came from the
existing-categories dropdown or a freshly-typed new category.

**Save.**
- New material: generates a UUID v4 `id`, calls
  `CustomMaterialLibraryService.create`, closes the dialog. The picker
  dropdown reflects the new entry on its next open. The newly-created
  entry is auto-selected on the layer row that opened the dialog (if
  the dialog was opened from a layer row).
- Edit: calls `CustomMaterialLibraryService.update`. Per ADR-021
  Rule 8, existing `MaterialLayer` rows that captured the old λ /
  density / specific-heat values keep them. The save banner under the
  Manage screen shows a brief confirmation; in the picker dropdown the
  updated entry appears with the new values on next open.

**Errors.**
- File write failure → toast in `errorRed`: *"Could not save to library
  file. Check disk space or permissions and try again."* The SQLite
  row is rolled back per ADR-021 Rule 5; the dialog stays open with
  the user's values intact.
- Library not configured → the dialog never opens (its entry points
  are disabled per §5.7.1 item 2 and §5.7.3).

#### §5.7.3 Manage Custom Materials Screen

Reached from:
- §5.7.1 item 3 ("Manage custom materials…" link in the picker
  dropdown).
- Settings screen "Custom material library" → **Manage…** button
  (§9.2).

Full-screen scaffold on tablet, modal dialog (max width 720 px) on
desktop.

**Layout.**
- Header row with "+ Add" button (opens §5.7.2 in add mode) and a
  close button (✕).
- Library path summary with **Browse…**, **Clear**, **Reload from
  file** buttons (mirrors Settings §9.2).
- Search field that filters across name / manufacturer.
- Grouped list using the same `category › subcategory` taxonomy as the
  picker dropdown, listing only `isBuiltIn = false` entries. Empty
  state: *"No custom materials yet. Press **+ Add** to create your
  first one."*

**Row affordances.**
- **Edit** button → opens §5.7.2 in edit mode pre-filled with the
  entry.
- **Delete** (🗑) button → confirmation dialog:

  ```
  Delete "Custom hemp board"?
  This will remove it from your custom material library file
  and from the in-app database.
  [ Cancel ]   [ Delete ]
  ```

  If the material is used by any `MaterialLayer`, the dialog
  instead shows the **block message** from ADR-021 Rule 7 with a
  per-construction usage list and a single **OK** button — no delete.

**Browse / Reset to default / Reload.**
- **Browse…** → opens a file picker; accepts `*.json` /
  `*.matlib.json`. On selection, calls
  `CustomMaterialLibraryService.setLibraryPath(<chosen>)`. The screen
  reloads its list automatically.
- **Reset to default** → only shown when an explicit user path is
  active (i.e. `customMaterialLibraryPath != null`). Confirmation:
  *"Switch back to the default library file? Your custom materials
  from the current file will no longer appear unless you Browse back
  to it. The current file on disk is not modified."* On confirm,
  calls `setLibraryPath(null)`, which reverts to the ADR-021 Rule 14
  default path.
- **Reload from file** → calls `reloadFromFile()` and shows
  *"Reloaded N custom materials"* toast.

**Tablet adaptation.** Replaces "Edit" / "🗑" inline buttons with a
trailing "⋮" overflow menu per row; the header collapses the three
file-action buttons into a single overflow menu "⋮" to the right of
the path.

```

**Hover-to-highlight interaction:**
- Wrapping each warning row in a `MouseRegion` (desktop) detects pointer enter/exit.
- On pointer enter: set `hoveredElementProvider` to `SelectedElement(type: result.elementType, id: result.elementId)`.
- On pointer exit: clear `hoveredElementProvider` to null.
- The canvas painters read `hoveredElementProvider` and draw a 2px `hoverHighlight` colour outline (at 60% opacity) around the matching element. The highlight applies to walls, zones, circuits, and the distributor; rooms are highlighted by outlining all their walls.
- The hover highlight is purely visual — it does not change the selection (`selectedElementProvider`) and does not open the properties panel.
- On tablet (no hover): a long-press on the warning row triggers the same highlight for 2 seconds, then clears.

#### 7.2.1 Floor and Ceiling Envelope Section

Below the heat demand numbers, show a collapsible section labelled **"Envelope
— Floor & Ceiling"** (collapsed by default, expands on tap).

**Floor subsection:**

```
Floor
  What's below?  [ Ground ▾ ]          ← boundary condition dropdown
  Construction   [ Not assigned  Edit ] ← button opens WallConstruction editor
  Correction f.  0.60                   ← read-only for Ground/Exterior;
                                           slider 0.0–1.0 for Unheated Space
```

**Ceiling subsection (identical layout):**

```
Ceiling
  What's above?  [ Exterior roof ▾ ]
  Construction   [ Not assigned  Edit ]
  Correction f.  1.00                   ← read-only 1.0 for Exterior
```

**Boundary condition dropdown options:**

| Display label | `BoundaryCondition` value | Correction factor shown |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Ground (slab on grade) | `ground` | 0.60 (read-only, with ⓘ tooltip explaining ISO 13370 simplification) |
| Exterior / Roof | `exterior` | 1.00 (read-only) |
| Unheated attic | `unheatedSpace` | Slider 0.0–1.0, pre-filled 0.80 |
| Unheated basement / garage | `unheatedSpace` | Slider 0.0–1.0, pre-filled 0.60 |
| Unheated crawlspace | `unheatedSpace` | Slider 0.0–1.0, pre-filled 0.50 |
| Adjacent heated room (same temp) | `interior` | 0.00 (read-only, "No heat loss") |

> **Note on preset vs custom:** "Unheated attic", "Unheated basement / garage",
> and "Unheated crawlspace" all map to `BoundaryCondition.unheatedSpace` — they
> differ only in the pre-filled correction factor value. After selecting a
> preset, the user can drag the slider to override. This avoids exposing
> `BoundaryCondition` as an enum to the user while still giving full control.

**Construction button behaviour:**
- If no construction assigned: button label "Not assigned  [+ Assign]"
- If assigned: button label shows construction name + computed U-value,
  e.g. "Flat roof 200mm EPS — U 0.18 W/(m²K)  [Edit]"
- Tapping opens the same `WallConstruction` editor modal used for walls
  (Section 5.7), pre-titled "Floor construction" or "Roof/ceiling construction"

**When construction is not assigned:**
- Floor/ceiling transmission loss rows in the heat demand breakdown show "—"
- Total heat demand shows "—" and a diagnostic tooltip:
  "Floor or ceiling construction missing — assign a construction to include
  slab heat loss in the demand calculation. If the floor/ceiling has
  negligible heat loss (e.g. well-insulated party wall to identical heated
  room), set boundary to 'Adjacent heated room'."
- Zone colour is NOT affected by missing floor/ceiling construction — only
  missing wall constructions trigger the grey NaN state (because wall U-values
  dominate; floor/ceiling are optional refinements)

**Spacing and layout:**
- The envelope section uses `md` (16px) padding
- Boundary dropdown: full width
- Construction button: full width, left-aligned label, right-aligned action
- Correction factor row: label left, value or slider right (slider width 120px)

#### 7.2.2 Rectangular Room Dimensions

Shown **only** when the selected room is rectangle-eligible (ADR-012 Rule 1:
exactly 4 axis-aligned walls forming four 90° corners). Hidden entirely for
non-rectangular rooms — "width/height" is undefined for L-shapes, consistent
with ADR-012's rationale.

| Field | Type | Editable | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| Width  | Numeric input (cm) | Yes | ≥ 10 cm |
| Height | Numeric input (cm) | Yes | ≥ 10 cm |

- Width = room bounding-box extent along x; Height = extent along y.
- Value applies on **Enter or focus loss** (not per keystroke — a
  geometry-reshaping field must not reshape mid-typing). No Apply button.
- Resize is top-left-anchored, atomic across all four walls, one undo entry,
  min 10×10 cm — see `DECISIONS.md` ADR-015.
- Invalid/too-small input reverts the field and shows toast
  "Room too small (min 10×10 cm)".

### 7.3 Wall Segment Selected

| Field | Type | Editable |
|-------|------|----------|
| Wall type | Dropdown: Exterior/Interior/Partition | Yes |
| Length (inner clear) | Display (mm) | No (change by moving endpoints; per ADR-017 this is the inner edge length, not centerline) |
| Length (centerline) | Display (mm), small secondary text | No |
| Thickness | Display (mm) — shows "240 mm (project default)" when `constructionId == null`, otherwise "275 mm (from construction)" | No (set via construction or settings) |
| Anchor face | Dropdown: Centerline / Inner face / Outer face | Yes — **disabled with tooltip** when wall is shared (`mirrorId != null`); locked to Centerline per ADR-017 Rule 3 |
| Orientation | Display (N/S/E/W) | No (auto-calculated) |
| Construction | Button → opens construction editor | Yes |
| U-value | Display (W/m²K) | No (calculated) |
| Adjacent room | Display or dropdown | Yes for interior walls |
| [Edit Construction] | Button | Opens modal (Section 5.7) |

**Pinned-face glyph (ADR-017 Rule 10).** When a wall is selected the canvas
draws a small lock/pin icon on the anchored face:
- `anchorMode == innerFace` → glyph rendered on the inner face midpoint
- `anchorMode == outerFace` → glyph rendered on the outer face midpoint
- `anchorMode == centerline` → **no glyph** (centerline is the implicit
  default; this also covers every shared wall)

Glyph styling: 14 px diameter, `primaryLight` fill, `surface` stroke 1.5 px,
rendered in screen space (not world space) so it stays a constant size
regardless of zoom. Tooltip on hover: *"This face stays fixed when the wall
thickness changes."*

### 7.4 Heating Zone Selected

| Field | Type | Editable |
|-------|------|----------|
| Zone type | Toggle: Floor / Wall | Yes |
| Tube spacing | Slider 50-400mm + numeric | Yes |
| Tube type | Dropdown (from tube library) | Yes |
| Flooring material | Dropdown (from flooring library) | Yes |
| Layout pattern | Radio: Meander/Spiral/Bifilar/Counterflow | Yes |
| Border distance | Slider 50-300mm | Yes |
| **Computed** |
| Zone area | Display (m²) | No |
| Tube length (zone only) | Display (m) | No |
| Specific output | Display (W/m²) | No |
| Total output | Display (W), colour-coded | No |
| Surface temperature | Display (°C), warn if over limit | No |

### 7.5 Distributor Selected

| Field | Type | Editable |
|-------|------|----------|
| Supply temperature | Slider 20-55°C + numeric | Yes |
| Return temperature | Slider + numeric, must be < supply | Yes |
| Pump capacity | Numeric input (Pa), optional | Yes |
| **Computed (shown after circuits connected)** |
| Required pump head | Display (Pa), read-only (see ADR-007) | No |
| Number of circuits | Display | No |
| Total flow rate | Display (kg/h) | No |

## 9. Settings Screen

Accessible from the overflow menu (⋮) on tablet, and from the app menu bar on desktop. A simple scrollable form — no tabs at this stage.

### 9.1 General Settings

| Field | Control | Values | Default |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| Drawing grid size | Dropdown | 5mm / 10mm / 25mm / 50mm / 100mm | 100mm |
| Default exterior wall thickness | Numeric (cm) | 5–100 | 24 |
| Default interior wall thickness | Numeric (cm) | 5–100 | 12 |
| Default partition wall thickness | Numeric (cm) | 5–100 | 10 |

**Behaviour:**
- Changing the grid size takes effect immediately on the canvas — no Apply button.
- The selected value is persisted in `AppPreferences` (`gridSpacingMm`) and restored on next launch.
- The dropdown label shows the value with its unit: "100 mm", "25 mm", etc.
- Grid size is global (not per-project).
- The three wall-thickness defaults are **project settings** (persisted on
  the `Project` row, not `AppPreferences`). Editing one cascades to every
  `WallSegment` of the matching `wallType` that has `constructionId == null`,
  re-anchoring each centerline per its `anchorMode`. Walls with an explicit
  construction are unaffected (their thickness is sourced from the
  construction's layer sum). See `DECISIONS.md ADR-017` Rule 9.
- Inputs are in centimetres, parsed → mm = round(cm × 10), validated against
  the model range (50–1000 mm). Invalid values revert the field and toast
  *"Wall thickness must be 5–100 cm"*.
- **No "dimension display" toggle.** Per EN 12831 simplified method, the app
  always displays inner clear (Lichtmaß) dimensions; outer envelope is a
  derived rendering quantity only. See ADR-017.

### 9.2 Custom Material Library

A dedicated section in the Settings form, below the general settings.
See `DECISIONS.md` ADR-021. Per ADR-021 Rule 14 a default library
file always exists, so there is no "library not configured" state.

```
Custom material library
  File path     [ ~/Documents/HeatingPlanner/                 ]
                [ custom_materials.matlib.json   (default)    ]
                [ Browse…  ]  [ Reset to default  ]  [ Reload ]
                Status: ✓ Loaded 12 custom materials

                                              [ Manage materials… ]
```

**Behaviour.**
- **File path** is a read-only display field showing the *effective*
  absolute path returned by
  `CustomMaterialLibraryService.resolvedLibraryPath()`. When
  `customMaterialLibraryPath == null` the resolved path is the
  Rule 14 default; render a small `(default)` chip in
  `onSurfaceSecondary` next to the truncated path. When non-null,
  no chip. Tooltip on hover shows the full path.
- **Browse…** opens a file picker. Filter: `*.json`,
  `*.matlib.json`. The picker is in **save-or-open** mode: if the
  chosen path does not exist, the service creates it with an empty
  library skeleton (`{"version":"1.0","materials":[]}`); if it
  exists and parses, its entries are loaded per ADR-021 Rule 4.
  Sets `customMaterialLibraryPath` to the chosen absolute path.
- **Reset to default** — visible only when an explicit user path is
  set. Calls `setLibraryPath(null)` after the confirmation in
  §5.7.3. Reverts to the default file. The user-picked file on disk
  is not touched.
- **Reload from file** re-runs the sync pass and shows a toast
  *"Reloaded N custom materials"*. Always enabled — the effective
  path is always defined.
- **Status line** shows one of:
  - "✓ Loaded N custom materials" (success, `success` colour)
  - "⚠ File could not be loaded — check the path and try Reload"
    (`warningAmber`) — used for both missing-file and parse-error
    cases; the toast from the sync pass carries the specific reason
- **Manage materials…** button — full-width, right-aligned — opens
  the Manage Custom Materials screen (§5.7.3). Always enabled.

The library path is global (not per-project) and persisted in
`AppPreferences.customMaterialLibraryPath`. A null value persists as
"use default" — it is **not** treated as "no library".

## 10. Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout Changes |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Desktop Large | ≥ 1200dp | Full layout: toolbar + canvas + properties panel (280px) |
| Desktop Medium | 900-1199dp | Narrower properties panel (240px) |
| Tablet Landscape | 600-899dp | Floating toolbar, bottom sheet properties, status bar simplified |
| Tablet Portrait | < 600dp | Same as tablet landscape but canvas is taller; properties sheet starts collapsed |

---

## 11. Accessibility Requirements

- All interactive elements must have semantic labels for screen readers.
- Colour is never the sole indicator of status — always pair with text or icon (e.g., zone adequacy uses colour + text label).
- Focus order follows logical tab sequence: toolbar → canvas → properties panel.
- High-contrast mode: provide an alternative colour scheme where all colours meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for graphics).
- Touch targets on tablet: minimum 44 × 44 logical pixels. Toolbar icons: 48 × 48.
- Canvas zoom and pan must be achievable without multi-touch (accessibility settings can map to single-finger drag + pinch buttons).

## 13. Save, Autosave & Session Restore

### 12.1 Two-Tier Persistence — User-Facing Mental Model

HeatingPlanner never loses work. The app continuously saves all project data to its internal database the moment any change is made — drawing a wall, adjusting a temperature, editing a layer. The user never needs to press Save to avoid losing data.

"Save" (Ctrl/Cmd + S) and "Save As" (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + S) are about exporting to a portable `.hsp` file — useful for sharing between devices, sending to a colleague, or creating a backup outside the app.

**This distinction must be communicated clearly in the UI.** Do not use language like "unsaved changes" without qualifying that data is safe in the app.

### 12.2 Save State Indicator (Status Bar)

The right side of the status bar shows a compact save indicator. Three states:

| Situation | Indicator | Tooltip on hover |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Project never exported to `.hsp` | (nothing) | — |
| All changes reflected in `.hsp` | "✓ Saved" in `onSurfaceSecondary` | "All changes saved to file" |
| Changes made since last `.hsp` export | ● (amber dot, 6px) | "File export out of date — press Ctrl+S to update" |
| Auto-export in progress | ⟳ spinning (12px) + "Saving…" | "Saving to file…" |
| Auto-export failed | ⚠ amber icon | "Could not save to file — check disk space or permissions" |

The indicator appears only when the project has a file path. New projects or projects opened directly from the app database show no indicator (they are always fully safe without a file).

### 12.3 Window Title

On desktop, the window title format is:

```
{ProjectName} — HeatingPlanner          ← clean state or no .hsp
{ProjectName} ● — HeatingPlanner        ← .hsp out of date
{ProjectName} — HeatingPlanner (Saving…)← auto-export running
```

The ● indicator mirrors the status bar dot. It follows the platform convention (macOS uses a dot in the close button; this supplements that with visible text).

### 12.4 Manual Save Flows

**Ctrl/Cmd + S — Save to existing file:**
- If the project already has a file path: silently overwrites. Status bar shows "✓ Saved" for 2 seconds then reverts to normal state.
- If no file path yet: opens a "Save As" file picker dialog.

**Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + S — Save As:**
- Always opens a file picker.
- Default filename: `{ProjectName}.hsp`
- Filter: `*.hsp` files.
- On confirm: exports and establishes the new path as the auto-export target.
- On cancel: no change.

**File menu → Save / Save As:** same as shortcuts above.

### 12.5 Quit / Close with Unsaved File Export

When the user closes the window or quits the app while the `.hsp` is out of date:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Unsaved export file                                      │
│                                                           │
│  "{ProjectName}" has changes not yet written to the       │
│  .hsp export file. Your project is safely stored in the   │
│  app — this only affects the portable file.               │
│                                                           │
│  [ Save File and Quit ]   [ Quit Anyway ]   [ Cancel ]   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- "Save File and Quit": export `.hsp` then close. Show brief progress spinner.
- "Quit Anyway": close without exporting. All data remains safe in the database.
- "Cancel": dismiss dialog, return to the app.

If the project has **never** been exported to a file (no path set), close without any dialog — there is nothing to warn about.

### 12.6 App Startup — Session Restore

On every launch, the app remembers the last open project and reopens it directly:

1. **Last project found in database → open it directly.** Skip the project list screen. The canvas restores to the same zoom and pan position the user left. No loading dialog — show the editor immediately with the Drift stream providing data.
2. **First launch / last project deleted → show Project List Screen.** Same as current behaviour.
3. **Project list screen → tap a project → open it** and remember it as the new last-opened project.

There is no "restoring session…" splash screen or notification — the restoration is seamless. The editor opens and data loads through the normal reactive providers.

### 12.7 Autosave Feedback (In-Session)

The autosave to `.hsp` is silent and background. Do not interrupt the user with toasts or dialogs for successful autosaves. Only surface feedback for:

- **Success:** status bar indicator transitions cleanly from ● to ✓.
- **Failure:** amber ⚠ icon in status bar + tooltip. Does not interrupt editing.
- **Manual save shortcut:** show "✓ Saved" text in status bar for 2 seconds as a tactile confirmation.

**Never** block the canvas or show a full-screen loading state for any save operation.
